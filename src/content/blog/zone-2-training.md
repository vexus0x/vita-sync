## What is Zone 2 Training?

Zone 2 training refers to exercise at approximately **60-70% of your maximum heart rate**. This is the intensity where your body primarily burns fat for fuel and can sustain conversation (the "talk test").

## The Benefits

### 1. Mitochondrial Density
Zone 2 training increases mitochondrial density—the powerhouses of your cells. More mitochondria = more energy production and better metabolic health.

### 2. Fat Adaptation
Your body becomes more efficient at burning fat for fuel, improving metabolic flexibility and endurance.

### 3. Cardiovascular Health
Regular Zone 2 exercise strengthens your heart without excessive stress, reducing cardiovascular disease risk.

### 4. Longevity
Studies show that moderate-intensity cardio is associated with longer lifespan compared to high-intensity training alone.

## How to Find Your Zone 2

**The Talk Test:** You should be able to speak in full sentences, but not sing.

**Heart Rate Formula:**
- Max HR = 220 - your age
- Zone 2 = 60-70% of Max HR

## Sample Zone 2 Workouts

| Workout | Duration | Activity |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Easy Run | 30-45 min | 60-65% max HR |
| brisk Walk | 45-60 min | 60-65% max HR |
| Cycling | 45-90 min | 60-70% max HR |
| Swimming | 30-45 min | 60-70% max HR |

## Weekly Schedule

Aim for **90-180 minutes per week** of Zone 2 training for optimal benefits. This can be split across 3-5 sessions.

## Combining with HIIT

Zone 2 doesn't exclude high-intensity training. Many athletes use a 80/20 split:
- 80% Zone 2
- 20% High-intensity

This balanced approach provides the best of both worlds for fitness and longevity.
